 Challenge: JSON-to-Excel Converter Tool

Create a Python utility that reads structured data (like you'd get from an API) from a `.json` file and converts it to a CSV file that can be opened in Excel.

Your program should:
1. Read from a file named `api_data.json` in the same folder.
2. Convert the JSON content (a list of dictionaries) into `converted_data.csv`.
3. Automatically extract field names as CSV headers.
4. Handle nested structures by flattening or skipping them.

Bonus:
- Provide feedback on how many records were converted
- Allow user to define which fields to extract
- Handle missing fields gracefully
